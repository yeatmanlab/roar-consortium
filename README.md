# ROAR Consortium

The [ROAR project](https://roar.stanford.edu/) is developed and maintained by a [collaborative research group](https://edneuro.stanford.edu/). The ROAR consortium is a collective of authors who have substantively contributed to ROAR research and the purpose of this repository is to document the membership of the ROAR consortium.

## Inclusion in the ROAR consortium

We welcome all contributions to ROAR and aim to be as inclusive as possible in consortium membership.
If you would like to be added to ROAR consortium, please submit a pull request to this repository, adding your name and information to the `authors.json` file to include your information. An author listing looks like this:
