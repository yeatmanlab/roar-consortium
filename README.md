The ROAR consortium is a collective of authors who have substantively contributed to ROAR research and the purpose of this repository is to document the membership of the ROAR consortium.

If you would like to be added to ROAR consortium, please submit a pull request to this repository, editing the `authors.json` file to include your information. Or alternatively, open an issue asking the repository maintainers to add your name.
